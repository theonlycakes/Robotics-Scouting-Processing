# Processing
 
This is the other half of my Scouting page that generates a csv file. This will be able to process given inputs and determine which team is the best and will be able to give an overview of a specific teams abilities based of the data provided.

Things to do 
- [ ] Display individual stats about each team
- [ ] Display a best team fit page 
- [ ] Calcutate where robots should be on the bar to balance it 
- [ ] Make the UI better
